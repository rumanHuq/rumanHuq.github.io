I’ve been meaning to start a blog for a while. Not because I had some content strategy or a five-year plan — I just thought it’d be nice to have a place where my thoughts don’t disappear into the void of tabs, notes apps, and half-finished docs.

Since I’ve been working with frontend tech for over eight years, I figured I’d build it myself. Obviously, I got stuck making it *too* nice. I got deep into layout tweaks, color choices, animations, and "clean" code. Basically, I fell into the classic trap: procrastinating under the illusion of productivity.

Eventually, I realized I wasn’t trying to build a blog — I was trying to *perfect it before it even existed.*

So I changed gears. I picked [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) — because it felt familiar, and there wasn’t much of a learning curve for me. Then I found [**AstroPaper**](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), a blog theme built on top of Astro that gave me the perfect starting thread. Clean, minimal, and ready to go — exactly what I needed to stop tinkering and start writing.

I’m still likely to tweak it over time (tinkering is half the fun), but I’ve decided to use what’s there and build on it gradually, instead of waiting for the perfect setup.

### So, what’s this blog for?

Honestly? It’s just a place to write down the things I keep thinking about anyway.

Sometimes that means:

* Stuff I’m exploring in **frontend, & backend**
* Journaling the **AWS learning**
* **Working out**, because it helps calm the brain
* The occasional **recipe or food experiment**
* And a bit of **self-reflection**, especially around ADHD and how I try to stay on track

I don’t know what shape this blog will take — and I’m not trying to turn it into anything more than a space to write, share, and think out loud. If that sounds like your kind of chaos, feel free to tag along.
